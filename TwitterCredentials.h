// Put your twitter credentials in this file for use by the demo
// AppController.

// Changes to this file will not be committed (this file is in .gitignore)

// Hard-coding credentials elsewhere in the project is inadvisable, as you
// may inadvertantly disclose this information with a careless commit.

// In production/distributed code, be sure to take additional measures to
// protect your consumer secret, never *ever* store Twitter passwords,
// and be sure to read Twitter's security best practices:
